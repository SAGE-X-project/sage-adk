What's Needed:
- Integrate nonce validation
- Integrate duplicate detection
- Integrate message ordering
- Integrate replay protection

## Not Implemented

### ❌ HPKE Integration
**Status**: Not Started
**Location**: Would use `sage/hpke`

What's Needed:
- Create wrapper around sage/hpke
- Integrate with session management
- Add key derivation
- Add encryption/decryption

### ❌ Smart Contract Integration
**Status**: Not Started
**Location**: Would use `sage/contracts`

What's Needed:
- Integrate Ethereum contracts
- Integrate Solana contracts
- Add DID registry interactions
- Add challenge-response

### ❌ Health Check Integration
**Status**: Not Started
**Location**: Would use `sage/health`

What's Needed:
- Integrate component health checks
- Add liveness/readiness/startup probes
- Merge with existing observability/health

### ❌ Key Rotation
**Status**: Not Started
**Location**: Would use `sage/crypto/rotation`

What's Needed:
- Add automated rotation policies
- Add rotation scheduling
- Add key archival

### ❌ Config Unification
**Status**: Not Started

What's Needed:
- Merge sage/config and sage-adk/config
- Create unified schema
- Add migration utilities

## Revised Effort Estimate

**Original Estimate**: 5 weeks (25 days)
**Revised Estimate**: 1.5-2 weeks (7-11 days)

**Savings**: ~14-18 days due to existing implementation

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate** (Today):
   - Integrate RFC 9421 into signing.go
   - Integrate message validation into adapter.go
   - Complete SAGE adapter SendMessage/ReceiveMessage

2. **This Week**:
   - End-to-end testing of complete SAGE adapter
   - Fix any integration issues
   - Write integration tests

3. **Next Week**:
   - HPKE integration
   - Smart contract integration
   - Health check integration

## Files Modified

### New Files Created
- ✅ `docs/REFACTORING_CHECKLIST.md`
- ✅ `docs/REFACTORING_PLAN.md`
- ✅ `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md` (this file)

### Modified Files
- ✅ `builder/builder.go`
  - Added `WithKeyManager()`
  - Added `WithKeyPair()`
  - Added `WithKeyPath()`

### Files to Modify
- `adapters/sage/signing.go` - Add RFC 9421 integration
- `adapters/sage/adapter.go` - Complete implementation
- `adapters/sage/validation.go` - Create new file for validation

## Testing Status

### Existing Tests (All Passing)
- ✅ `adapters/sage/keys_test.go`
- ✅ `adapters/sage/session_test.go`
- ✅ `adapters/sage/handshake_test.go`
- ✅ `adapters/sage/signing_test.go`
- ✅ `adapters/sage/encryption_test.go`
- ✅ `adapters/sage/transport_test.go`
- ✅ `adapters/sage/integration_test.go`
- ✅ `adapters/sage/integration_config_test.go`

### Tests to Add
- `adapters/sage/rfc9421_test.go` - RFC 9421 integration tests
- `adapters/sage/validation_test.go` - Message validation tests
- `adapters/sage/adapter_integration_test.go` - Full adapter tests

## Conclusion

The SAGE integration is **much further along** than initially assessed. The core security components are implemented and tested. The remaining work focuses on:

1. **Integration** of existing sage/ features (RFC 9421, validation)
2. **Completion** of the adapter implementation
3. **Enhancement** with advanced features (HPKE, contracts, rotation)

This significantly reduces the implementation timeline from 5 weeks to **1.5-2 weeks**.
